# Avocado
This project is based on pricing data for Avocados ðŸ¥‘. An important part of the California Economy. My goal was to clean, provide visualization, and conduct a hypothesis and permutation test with Avocado pricing data. This was used as nothing more than an exercise for me. I practiced a little bootstrapping too.
